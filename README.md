# Heart_Disease_Prediction

## Project Description
Anybody anywhere has been provided the PERFECT tool to predict their risk of having heart-related diseases via this ML.NET-powered tool

## Problem Statement
This problem is centered around developing an ASP.NET Core MVC Web application that will predict the presence of heart disease based on 14 attributes i.e age, sex, and cp etc. given by the user. 
To solve this problem, we will build an ML model that takes an input of 14 columns of data from the user, 13 are featured columns (also called independent variables) plus the 'Label' column which is what you want to predict, and in this case, is named 'num', which will tell us the predicted result. 
Here is the Traning Data downloaded from UCI ML Repository
